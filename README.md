About me: I am a graduate student studying the intersection of science, law, and technology through Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law's Master of Science in Law program. I have a BS in Earth Science with a concentration in Environmental Geology from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I studied things like climate dynamics, seismotechtonics, and isotopic geochemistry.
